# Stwo CUDA Challenge

Optimize the production Cairo and circuit-recursion CUDA paths in
[`stwo-zig`](https://github.com/teddyjfpender/stwo-zig) on one H200. The ranked
workload starts with **already adapted** Starknet PIE inputs, proves each PIE,
wraps Cairo proofs in circuit verifier proofs, and folds consecutive leaves to
one recursive root. The judge owns the inputs, clock, memory measurement,
security settings, independent Cairo verification, and canonical root checks.

**Launch scope:** the intended research target is GPU proving time. The
implemented `h200-v1` judge currently scores the full adapted-input-to-proof
command, including ingress and publication, and is **not live**. Six Cairo PIE
proof-stage timings are retained (1.17–1.95 s); wrap/fold proof-only timers are
still missing. The [activation decision](spec/ACTIVATION.md) requires a new
proof-stage scoring epoch and fresh baselines before a proving-time leaderboard
can open. The direct 6.90–9.78 s Cairo figures are full-command diagnostics.
The [staging website](https://autoresearch-web-lac.vercel.app/challenges/stwo-cuda)
accepts no ranked submissions; it links to this repository for research PRs
and Discussions.
The reviewed [PR status](data/reports/submission-review-2026-10-02.tsv) and
[per-case research measurements](data/reports/submission-research-2026-10-02.tsv)
for PRs #3, #4, and #6 are published separately from signed scores. PR #6 is
the current [accepted starting frontier](frontier/manifest.json); this is an
unranked source promotion, not a signed leaderboard result.
PR #4's narrower [PoW primitive results](data/reports/submission-pow-primitives-2026-10-02.tsv)
are retained alongside its full-command regressions.

The prover's CUDA implementation lives in upstream `stwo-zig`. This challenge
pins one commit from its `main` branch and checks it out under
`workspace/stwo-zig` after `python3 challenge.py setup`. Setup overlays the
reviewed CUDA [frontier patch](frontier/changes.patch) by default; `--base`
leaves a fresh checkout at the original pin. Participants submit cumulative
changes to the allowed CUDA paths as
`candidate/changes.patch` in their challenge-repository PRs. The judge applies
that full patch to a clean pinned checkout before building and measuring it. This
keeps one production source tree and gives maintainers a source diff to apply
or rebase upstream. A PR should explain its CUDA changes in
`candidate/NOTES.md`; the patch is the reviewable source diff, not a binary
artifact. The challenge's `harness/` contains only measurement and validation
code. `./setup.sh` obtains the exact source commit and accepted frontier. Public inputs and retained
reference proofs are under
[`data/`](data/README.md), with the scored fixture contract in
[`fixtures/public-v1.json`](fixtures/public-v1.json).

Start with [TASK.md](TASK.md) and the [exact CUDA source map](spec/CODE_MAP.md).
Run `python3 challenge.py paths` to see the local checkout path; there is no
`/workspaces/stwo-zig` directory, and `workspace/` is ignored in Git. A fresh
clone therefore has no prover source until setup runs. The fixed contract is [benchmark.json](benchmark.json),
the workload and proof obligations are in [spec/WORKLOADS.md](spec/WORKLOADS.md),
and the scoring and tradeoffs are in [spec/SCORING.md](spec/SCORING.md).
The [submission guide](spec/SUBMISSIONS.md) lists editable CUDA files,
validation, Discussion use, PR contents, and the separate judge intake step.
Coding agents can load the repository's
[participant skill](skills/stwo-cuda-challenge/SKILL.md); its commands are
available through [`challenge.py`](challenge.py). Both use paths relative to
this checkout.
The specific upstream design choices are recorded in
[spec/REFERENCES.md](spec/REFERENCES.md). The exact boundary before enabling
the live H200 leaderboard is in [spec/ACTIVATION.md](spec/ACTIVATION.md).

Three rankings use the **same validated proofs and measurements**. The public
basket currently has six component-diverse PIEs, two fixed-leaf root folds
(two leaves and eight distinct contiguous leaves), and two full PIE-to-root
modes (serial and integrated batch):

| Track | Objective | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latency` | Minimize the weighted geometric mean of adapted-input-to-publication time | Fastest usable H200 pipeline. |
| `memory` | Minimize the weighted geometric mean of whole-device peak bytes, with a latency guard | Make dense PIEs fit and enable later GPU choices. |
| `balanced` | Minimize normalized time × peak memory, with per-case guardrails | Explore the Pareto tradeoff; a capacity proxy, not a dollar-cost claim. |

Every score card publishes the uncompressed per-case `(time, memory)` ratios;
`harness/frontier.py` derives Pareto status across judged submissions.
Correctness is a hard gate for **all** tracks. The
ranked suite is fixed by a versioned, hash-pinned manifest; holdout inputs use
the same public shape classes. There is no score from a self-reported kernel
timer, a source-only static estimate, or an unverified proof.

## Development loop

1. Prepare Zig 0.15.2, CUDA/nvcc, ccache 4.0+, Cargo,
   `nightly-2026-01-15`, and
   `git lfs pull` on a Linux H200 workspace. Keep the toolchain, fixtures,
   checked preprocessing asset, verifiers, and baseline build on a reusable
   volume. Set `STWO_CUDA_BUILD_CACHE_ROOT` to a persistent directory;
   setup shares its archive/cubin and ccache entries between baseline and
   candidate builds while targeting only SM 90. The reviewed
   [fixed-artifact release](spec/RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md) lets setup
   download hash-verified Rust verifiers and canonical preprocessing data
   instead of rebuilding those unchanged inputs. The operator runs
   `scripts/h200_preflight.py --mode direct` before
   research proofs. A separate ranked judge host also needs Docker/NVIDIA,
   mount privileges, and the pinned sandbox image; its
   `--mode judge --image SHA256_ID` preflight fails before proof work if those
   gates are missing. `./setup.sh` creates the pinned baseline and editable
   checkout; it does not download private PIEs.
2. Run `python3 challenge.py paths`, then work in `workspace/stwo-zig` under
   the [allowed CUDA source paths](spec/CODE_MAP.md). The checkout already
   contains the accepted frontier; the baseline remains the original pin.
   Explore architecture
   hypotheses first, test whether independent wins compose, then refine the
   surviving design. Name the expected stage and minimum gain; run relevant
   small local tests before a GPU trial.
3. Capture the source diff with `./scripts/capture-candidate.sh`. Optionally
   attach a prebuilt binary digest for the fast screening tier. The binary is
   never a substitute for source in a ranked submission.
   Capture refreshes the derived CUDA manifests after kernel edits. The trusted
   builder checks them against source and pinned product policy; only the
   unmodified baseline must match the immutable upstream import hash.
4. Build both arms, the pinned Rust verifiers, and the canonical preprocessing
   asset with `./setup.sh --build`. On an idle H200, run a verified PIE and
   fold/pipeline A/B smoke with `scripts/h200_experiment.py`; its stage-gain
   gate prevents weak hypotheses from launching the full basket. The direct
   driver journals source/binary hashes, cold command, phase times, proof
   hashes, and whole-device peak for every run. A trusted `rank` run separately
   performs three ABBA rounds and emits signed scores only on a qualified
   sandboxed judge; direct results remain research evidence.
   For a verified one-case GPU timeline and 10 ms whole-device memory trace,
   use the [profiling runbook](spec/H200_PROFILING.md) before choosing a kernel
   or buffer-lifetime experiment. Profiled wall time is diagnostic.

On a prepared H200 host, the local loop is:

```sh
git lfs pull
python3 challenge.py check-data
python3 challenge.py setup
python3 challenge.py paths
# Edit allowed CUDA source paths in workspace/stwo-zig.
python3 challenge.py capture
python3 challenge.py setup --build
python3 challenge.py benchmark --tier smoke --track balanced
```

Use `python3 challenge.py benchmark --tier qualify` for all cases once and
`--tier rank` only on a qualified judge. The original `setup.sh`,
`scripts/capture-candidate.sh`, and `benchmark.sh` remain equivalent direct
entry points; `python3 challenge.py --help` lists the participant commands.
To package a candidate, update `candidate/NOTES.md`, then commit and push
`candidate/changes.patch` and `candidate/NOTES.md` in your challenge fork.
Open a PR against this challenge repository for review and link any relevant
[research Discussions](spec/DISCUSSIONS.md). Opening a PR does not start a
GPU run or constitute a ranked submission.
For this internal challenge, the PR enters a manual daily review queue.
The operator freezes its number and exact head SHA with `service/pr_batch.py`;
the optional HTTP intake is not required. The checked-in
[activation record](spec/ACTIVATION.md) tracks the later ranked-judge gate.
The benchmark defaults to the checked-in public inputs and setup assets under
`.cache/`; operator paths and the private manifest can be supplied with CLI
flags or the `STWO_*` variables shown in `.github/workflows/h200-rank.yml`.
The checked-in public files use Git LFS: run `git lfs pull` and
`python3 scripts/check_data.py` after cloning. In deployment the judge may
mount its own read-only content-addressed store with the same manifest-relative
paths. Run `python3 scripts/materialize_public.py --source workspace/stwo-zig
--out data/inputs --verify-only` to check the original public fixture contract
before spending GPU time. The canonical preprocessing
asset is generated from the pinned prover with `zig build
cairo-preprocessed-export -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` followed by
`zig-out/bin/cairo-preprocessed-export /absolute/path/preprocessed-canonical.bin
canonical`. Keep the 2 GiB asset outside Git.

Standalone PIE proofs use the pinned `stwo-cairo-official-verifier`. Registry
leaf proofs use the pinned Rust `verify_cairo_cuda_json` helper because their
Blake2s-M31/lifted proof shape is different. `./setup.sh --build` creates both
verifiers from the pinned baseline source; `--registry-cairo-verifier` can
override the latter path when using operator-managed assets.

Participants do not need the PIE API key. The operator creates a static
content-addressed bundle once, then hosts that directory over HTTPS:

```sh
python3 scripts/publish_public.py \
  --source data/inputs \
  --out ../stwo-cuda-challenge-public-bundle
python3 scripts/fetch_public.py \
  --base https://your-fixture-host.example/challenge/h200-v1 \
  --out data/inputs
```

The downloader checks the committed manifest digest and every blob SHA-256.
`--case-id` fetches only one case for a cheap smoke loop. The public bundle is
prepared locally; its HTTPS hosting remains part of deployment.

The service/runner design, artifact policy, isolation requirements, and H200
budget controls are in [spec/JUDGE.md](spec/JUDGE.md). The
[H200 operator runbook](spec/H200_RUNBOOK.md) gives the activation sequence.
The [operations map](spec/OPERATIONS.md) explains how PRs, intake, GitHub
Actions, signed receipts, and `autoresearch-web` fit together and which live
connections still need deployment.
For the internal daily batch, an operator reviews PRs, adds the
`ready-to-judge` label, and freezes their exact heads into local intake state:

```sh
python3 service/pr_batch.py --dry-run
python3 service/pr_batch.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state /operator/state
```

The standalone HTTP intake prototype and trusted dispatcher also remain
runnable locally:

```sh
python3 service/intake.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state ../stwo-cuda-challenge-state --token-file /secure/path/intake-token \
  --max-intake-requests-24h 100
python3 service/build_worker.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state ../stwo-cuda-challenge-state --submission-id ID
python3 service/dispatch.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state ../stwo-cuda-challenge-state --submission-id ID \
  --repository teddyjfpender/stwo-cuda-challenge --tier smoke --dry-run
```

`POST /submissions` takes `{"repository":"https://github.com/OWNER/FORK",
"commit":"FULL_SHA"}` and an optional `artifact_sha256`. It returns a job ID
after patch validation, without building or reserving the H200. The worker
rebuilds ranked binaries from source; uploaded artifacts are stored for future
untrusted fast screening only. A real H200 deployment requires a fixture
object store, verifier binaries, self-hosted runner, isolation, an externally
provisioned receipt signing key, chosen GPU dispatch budgets, and operator
secrets outside Git. Intake's request limit is persistent across restarts.
This repo does not claim to operate a live public ranking service yet.

The [public staging repository](https://github.com/teddyjfpender/stwo-cuda-challenge)
has Discussions enabled. Once an operator configures the dedicated H200
runner and judge variables, removing `--dry-run` dispatches a built submission
to the serialized workflow. Smoke, qualify, and rank receipts remain available
by tier as a submission progresses.
The manual `CPU sandbox probe` workflow exercises the image and filesystem
boundary on a hosted Linux runner; H200 GPU proof parity remains a separate
activation gate.

The current GitHub Discussions categories and research forms are in
[spec/DISCUSSIONS.md](spec/DISCUSSIONS.md). No benchmark source, proof blob,
API token, or private fixture belongs in a Discussion or submission PR.
