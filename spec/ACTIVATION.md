# H200 activation record

**Launch decision: staging, not open for ranked submissions (2026-10-02).**
The implemented `h200-v1` contract scores full-command time, while the intended
research target is GPU proving time. The website now foregrounds the six
retained Cairo proof-stage measurements and labels full-command measurements
separately. The next proof-stage epoch now has a defined judge-owned boundary
in [`PROOF_STAGE_EPOCH.md`](PROOF_STAGE_EPOCH.md), but its trusted adapter,
timers, and fresh paired baselines are not implemented. Do not launch the
full-command v1 ranking as though it were the proving-time challenge. Agents can use
the generated checkout, publish research in Discussions, and open review PRs
now. No PR or website number is a ranked result until the gates below are
qualified and the judge publishes a signed rank receipt. The operator should
keep the site's status at `staging` and should not advertise a live intake URL
or leaderboard while the runner, isolation, paired baseline, and receipt feed
are absent. The [source map](CODE_MAP.md) specifies exactly what agents edit.

This is the boundary between a tested challenge repository and a live ranked
service. The repository is public. No self-hosted H200 runner or
GitHub Actions judge variables are configured, so the manual H200 workflow
must not be dispatched yet. The concrete setup sequence is in
[`H200_RUNBOOK.md`](H200_RUNBOOK.md).

As checked on 2026-10-02, GitHub lists zero self-hosted runners for this
repository, and `service/activation.py` reports all ten H200 judge variables
missing. The funded Runpod session qualified the public proofs directly but
did not change these live-service gates. A 2026-10-02 inspection of the
available H200 pod found neither Docker nor `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; it cannot mount
the judge's per-case output images or qualify the isolated rank workflow.
The pod is retained for separate research use, not registered as a judge.
The later independent PR #6 comparison added three direct ABBA rounds across
all ten public cases, with exact canonical proofs and Rust verification. It
improved every PIE's full command but did not supply isolation, private
holdouts, or a signed rank receipt; its three-family direct gain was also
below that session's A/A noise threshold. PR #6 is promoted in the public
research record, not the ranked leaderboard. The paid H200 pod was stopped
after these measurements.

| Gate | Current evidence | Required activation evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proof-stage scope | The next epoch's judge-owned prepared-request boundary is specified in [`PROOF_STAGE_EPOCH.md`](PROOF_STAGE_EPOCH.md). Six Cairo PIE diagnostic proof stages are retained at 1.17–1.95 s; their 6.90–9.78 s full-command times include ingress. The trusted adapter and fold/pipeline proof-stage timers do not exist yet. | Implement the new epoch across all ten cases with withheld inputs and judge-owned timing, qualify its memory interval, re-run baselines, and align judge and website before launch. |
| Contract and data | `check_data.py` verified all 60 public files after transfer to the healthy H200 pod; contract CI also passes. | Repeat the full hash check on the eventual trusted runner. |
| Independent verifiers | Both pinned Rust verifiers were built on Linux and accepted all relevant Cairo proofs in two direct H200 rounds; executable hashes are recorded in [`data/reports/`](../data/reports/README.md). | Build both verifiers from the pinned baseline on the trusted runner and run them inside the judge. |
| Public PIE output files | All six PIEs passed two direct H200 rounds with exact proof hashes and pinned Rust verification; see [`data/reports/`](../data/reports/README.md). | Repeat inside the trusted H200 judge to qualify isolation and ranked timing. |
| Eight-leaf CUDA fold | The two- and eight-leaf CUDA folds passed two direct H200 rounds, each with exact proof, outputs, and packed root hashes. Both two-leaf end-to-end pipeline modes also passed with Rust-verified Cairo leaves. | Repeat the fold and full pipeline inside the trusted H200 judge. |
| Private holdout | A separate 18-case manifest passes hash preflight locally; it is not in Git. | Mount private fixtures read-only on the judge; qualify its PIE, fold, and full-pipeline cases with the pinned verifiers. |
| Scoring | Three tracks, guards, ABBA scheduling, A/A dispersion, and bootstrap checks are covered by local scorer tests. Two unpaired baseline-only H200 rounds are recorded as diagnostics. | Capture a fresh baseline and three valid paired H200 rounds on the same exclusive host; inspect variance and device-memory samples. |
| Intake and dispatch | The intake, trusted builder, tiered receipts, one-active-job dispatcher, exact-run claim, persistent intake limit, conservative rolling GPU budget, and detached Ed25519 signing path pass local tests. The daily PR collector freezes labeled PR heads and records submission IDs; the exporter and website build verify signed receipts before publication. | Configure the dedicated self-hosted runner, workflow variables, GPU budgets, and queue operations. Provision an external operator key, publish its authenticated public half, and run one source-only submission through smoke, qualify, and rank. The internal daily batch needs no always-on intake service. |
| Candidate isolation | The Docker/NVIDIA launcher stages case-only inputs and runtime assets and sanitizes the pipeline manifest. Hosted Linux [CPU probe #36923616450](https://github.com/teddyjfpender/stwo-cuda-challenge/actions/runs/36923616450) passed all eleven filesystem, network, PID, token, output, and forced-ENOSPC checks as UID 65532. A 2 GiB fixed-size per-case output filesystem and 64 MiB judge-side stdout cap are implemented; [`ISOLATION.md`](ISOLATION.md) defines the boundary. The available H200 research pod lacks Docker and mount privileges. | Use an H200 host with Docker/NVIDIA and mount privileges, build the pinned CUDA image, then qualify GPU access, quota, and the launcher with denied-access probes and valid PIE, fold, and pipeline proofs inside it. |

The operator builds assets with `./setup.sh --build`, hashes public fixtures
with `python3 scripts/check_data.py`, and uses `harness/run_arm.py --preflight`
against the private manifest before spending GPU time. The workflow's required
variables are listed in `.github/workflows/h200-rank.yml`; do not put private
paths, credentials, or holdout identifiers into this repository. The
`service/dispatch.py --dry-run` command checks a trusted build and tier gates
without reserving or launching a GPU job.
`python3 service/activation.py --repository OWNER/REPO` checks the live GitHub
runner and required variable names without displaying their values. A real
`service/dispatch.py` call performs this check before creating a workflow run.

Public release comes after these gates, with a reviewed contract epoch and a
fresh baseline score. Existing historical timings in the prover repository
are diagnostic evidence, not score denominators.
