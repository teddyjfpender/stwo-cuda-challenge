# Operating the challenge and website

The challenge repository is the **contract and candidate review surface**.
`stwo-zig` is the pinned production source. GitHub Discussions hold research
threads; challenge PRs hold reviewable patches and claims. Neither a Discussion
nor a PR is a judged score. The trusted service records immutable submissions,
builds allowed source, dispatches H200 jobs, and publishes signed receipts.
The website displays public research and GitHub activity, but its leaderboard
must be derived only from verified rank receipts.

## What exists now

- `service/intake.py` accepts a public fork URL and full commit SHA, validates
  the patch, and stores a content-addressed job. `service/pr_batch.py` now
  reads operator-labeled public PRs, freezes their exact head SHA, performs
  that same intake validation without an HTTP server, and records the PR ↔
  commit ↔ submission mapping. Its `--dry-run` mode is read-only. The HTTP
  intake remains optional and its bearer token is an operator credential.
- `service/build_worker.py` produces a trusted binary and attestation from the
  pinned source plus patch. `service/dispatch.py` enforces a single active H200
  attempt and budgets, then triggers the manual
  `.github/workflows/h200-rank.yml` workflow. The runner claims the exact
  dispatch, verifies proofs, and `service/publish_receipt.py` emits a redacted
  Ed25519-signed receipt. Smoke, qualify, and rank are distinct tiers.
- Public fixture files, direct H200 evidence, history, scoring, isolation
  code, and local service tests are checked in. Direct H200 evidence is not a
  scored or sandbox-qualified run.
- As verified on 2026-10-02, the GitHub repository is public, Discussions are
  enabled, and it has **zero self-hosted runners and zero Actions variables**.
  No public intake endpoint or signed ranked result exists yet. The live gates
  are tracked in [`ACTIVATION.md`](ACTIVATION.md).
- The current Git fetch at intake is unauthenticated. Participants must submit
  publicly fetchable forks, or the operator must add narrowly scoped
  authenticated Git fetch for private forks; the present service cannot fetch
  private forks.

## Daily manual PR batch

GitHub holds the queue; no always-on bot or H200 is needed between sessions.
The operator applies the `ready-to-judge` label only after reviewing a PR.
Run the following from this repository root, using persistent state **outside
Git** and a clean checkout of the pinned prover source:

```sh
python3 service/pr_batch.py --dry-run
python3 service/pr_batch.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state /operator/state
python3 service/build_worker.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state /operator/state --submission-id ID
python3 service/dispatch.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state /operator/state --submission-id ID \
  --repository teddyjfpender/stwo-cuda-challenge --tier smoke --dry-run
```

The collector is idempotent for the same PR head. It rejects a deleted/private
fork, invalid patch, or an identical patch previously owned by another SHA;
the operator sees each rejection in its JSON output. A new PR commit is a new
immutable candidate. Keep the mapping and receipts on a persistent volume,
even if the H200 host is shut down after each daily batch. Once the judge is
activated, use the [H200 runbook](H200_RUNBOOK.md) to dispatch smoke, qualify,
then rank serially with explicit daily budgets. The operator reviews rank
evidence and promotion decisions before publishing the site snapshot:

```sh
python3 service/site_export.py --source workspace/baseline \
  --state /operator/state --public-key /operator/operator-public.pem \
  --challenge-root . \
  --promotions /operator/promotions.json
```

The optional promotions file maps submission IDs to operator-approved track
names, for example `{"ID": ["latency"]}`. The exporter checks each selected
track was promotable against baseline in the signed judge receipt. A later
leader still requires a fresh head-to-head measurement and operator review;
the site never infers that promotion from public case rows. The export verifies
the Ed25519 signature and immutable PR/commit/patch/epoch binding, then writes
`data/site/scorecards.json`, the redacted signed receipts, and the public key
to this repository. Review and commit those files to challenge `main`. The
website reads one immutable challenge commit through GitHub every five minutes
and verifies each receipt signature and displayed score at render time. It
does not show ranked entries while the challenge status is `staging`.
`--website-root` remains available for an older static snapshot.

## Bring up the judge

1. Implement the intended proving-time launch epoch. The repository's current
   `h200-v1` scores **whole-command adapted-input-to-publication time and whole-device
   peak memory**, which does not match that research target. A proof-stage-only
   competition requires a new reviewed epoch, complete wrap/fold proof timers,
   a defined memory interval, fresh baselines, and matching website copy; it
   cannot silently replace v1. Use the contract in
   [`SCORING.md`](SCORING.md) as the authority.
2. On an exclusive H200 host, follow [`H200_RUNBOOK.md`](H200_RUNBOOK.md):
   install the pinned toolchain and Docker/NVIDIA runtime; clone the challenge,
   pull Git LFS, run setup and data checks; build and pin the sandbox image;
   stage public and private fixtures, the canonical preprocessing asset, and
   both independent Rust verifiers. Prove a PIE, fold, and full pipeline inside
   the sandbox. Keep private fixtures and credentials outside Git.
3. Put the persistent SQLite job/receipt state on storage available to intake,
   CPU builder, dispatcher, and the H200 workflow at the paths configured in
   `.github/workflows/h200-rank.yml`. Provision the Ed25519 signing key outside
   that state and publish its public key and digest through a trusted channel.
   Register the runner with `self-hosted` and `h200-stwo-challenge` labels, set
   every required `STWO_*` Actions variable, and run
   `python3 service/activation.py --repository OWNER/REPO`.
4. For the daily internal batch, use the PR collector above. A future public
   self-service mode would additionally need an authenticated HTTPS front
   door with participant identity and quotas. Never put the HTTP intake's
   shared operator token in browser JavaScript.
5. Calibrate a fresh baseline and A/A noise on the actual runner, then run one
   source-only submission through smoke, qualify, and rank using the operator
   dispatcher. Inspect the full judge evidence and independently verify the
   published signature before opening self-service access. PR open/synchronize
   events must not trigger paid H200 work automatically; a queue policy and
   budgets decide when to dispatch.

## Connect `autoresearch-web`

The website fetches the contract, baseline reports, research TSVs, and signed
scorecard feed directly from one immutable commit of this repository. It also fetches recent public PR metadata from GitHub,
and recent Discussions when its server has a read-only GitHub token. Its
`data/site/scorecards.json` is empty because no signed rank receipt exists yet.
The [`data/site/sources.json`](../data/site/sources.json) manifest selects the current
public report files. [`data/site/activation.json`](../data/site/activation.json)
provides website status and gate evidence; update both when publishing newer
measurements or changing activation state.
The manual export above provides a verified receipt-to-site path; the site remains
a public, read-only projection, separate from judge state and secrets. The
staging deployment is
[autoresearch-web-lac.vercel.app](https://autoresearch-web-lac.vercel.app):

1. Ingest challenge PR metadata through the
   [GitHub Pull Requests API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls): PR number, title/body,
   state, URL, head SHA, author login/avatar URL, and update time. Ingest
   relevant Discussions and comments through the
   [Discussions GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/using-the-graphql-api-for-discussions), storing IDs,
   category, title/body, author/avatar, links, and update time. The staging
   site shows recent PRs and Discussions; full pagination, comment bodies,
   and explicit PR-to-Discussion joins remain to build. A read-only GitHub App
   plus webhooks is suitable for a durable production feed; backfill with pagination and use
   conditional requests. Validate webhook deliveries with
   [`X-Hub-Signature-256`](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/validating-webhook-deliveries).
   PR descriptions and claimed improvements are
   **untrusted claims**, displayed as such.
2. The manual exporter publishes **redacted** receipt JSON, detached
   signatures, the operator public key, and a derived scorecard file into
   `data/site/` in this repository. It never
   copies SQLite, the shared bearer token, signing key, private case IDs, or
   unredacted evidence. The website rejects a changed or unsigned
   receipt. Its aggregate score comes from the signed judge output, including
   hidden holdouts; it must never rescore only the public per-case rows.
3. Rank results appear only after an operator-reviewed export and a challenge
   commit. The derived card retains receipt digest and PR URL for audit. The
   staging site still suppresses ranking until the H200 and scoring activation
   gates are met; merely opening a PR or publishing a research measurement
   never creates a ranked entry.
4. Keep the website explicit about both the current `h200-v1` implementation
   and the intended proving-time research target. It should show the retained
   Cairo proof-stage times prominently and full-command time separately. The
   two direct H200 runs are unranked research context. A live leaderboard
   still requires the trusted signed-receipt feed and a fresh paired baseline
   for each ranked submission; do not derive judged absolute values from the
   unpaired direct-run context.

GitHub provides review and social metadata; the judge provides proof validity
and measured performance. The website joins them by immutable commit and
submission ID. It should tolerate missing PR metadata without fabricating an
author or score, and tolerate a reviewed PR with no ranked receipt by showing
it as research only.
